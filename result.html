        There once was a {{ color }} {{ noun }} sitting in the Hackbright Lab.
        When {{ person }} went to pick it up, it burst into flames in a totally
        {{ adjective }} way.

        {%if night != None%}
        On a dark and spooky night, {{ person }} was wandering around and found the scraps of the {{ color }} {{ noun }} that had burst into flames.
        It was still {{ adjective }}. Also, it was a dream.
        {%endif%}
        {%if sky != None%}
        Days later, {{ person }} finds themselves on a {{color}} magical carpet, soaring through the sky with a {{ noun }} in the center of their palm. Is this still a dream?
        {%endif%}
        {%if underwater != None%}
        Gasping for air, {{person}} surfaces to the top of the ocean, clinging onto the {{noun}} to survive. They see themselves in the reflection of the water and notice that their skin has turned {{color}}.
